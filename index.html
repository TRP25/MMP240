    <h1>Tharaphi Tun</h1>
    <p>tharaphi@cuny.edu.bmcc</p>
    I want to live a happy life as I grow up, filled with joy, success, and meaningful connections. My goal is to surround myself with positivity, 
    chase my dreams, and embrace every moment with passion. Whether it's through dancing, creating videos, or sharing my thoughts with a like-minded community, 
    I want to inspire and be inspired. 
    <strong>My Name is Tharaphi Tun</strong>
    Happiness, for me, comes from doing what I love, staying true to myself, and enjoying life’s little moments—like snacking 
    all day and capturing memories through pictures and videos!
